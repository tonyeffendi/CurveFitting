# CurveFitting

Optimization is a very important problem in any fields. To solve this problem using MATLAB [1] is an easy task, furthermore its user-friendly interface and clear documentation attracts many users. However, MATLAB canâ€™t be used in a production code such as C++. In the past, to implement an algorithm to solve non linear least square problem usually adopts the code from the book of Numerical Recipes [2]. That implementation has a huge problem where one needs to provide the derivative of the cost function. If the cost function to optimize has n parameters, one need to derive its n partial derivative equation plus its implementation code, thus it is very error prone. 
Now, g2o [3] open source library solves this issue. However, many curve fitting examples [4,5] found solves only 3 parameters. In this project, an example to solve 5 parameters.
